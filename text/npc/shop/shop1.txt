Welcome!\nWe're in the middle of preopening!!
Between the bronze badge there are some bad apples...
The bronze badges know how to use the toilet.
Since it's easy for koyukkuri to hurt themselves when playing,\nplease spread some proper flooring in the yukkurarium.
If you leave the pool as it is, it'll become dirty and accidents\nmight occur. Please put it away after playing.
If the yukkurarium is too crowded, you can't get other yukkuri.\nKeep that in mind!
